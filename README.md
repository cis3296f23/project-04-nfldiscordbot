# NFL Discord Bot (Gridiron Guru)
Users on the Discord platform can enjoy the benefits of a server bot that effortlessly provides them with information from the National Football League (NFL), including scores and statistics all within their own servers. Discord is a popular platform where users can create communities to communicate and share media. For the bot to work, a user can write a command that the bot knows, and the bot will display its response to the user. With this bot, NFL communities in Discord can view desired data in a fast and efficient manner.

# Getting Started:
1. Requires a Discord Account (https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started)

## How to Run the Bot (Will Be Updated Later to Include an Executable)
